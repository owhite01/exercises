    //5. Modularity is a design technique that normally comprises dividing code up
    //into separate individual modules. Construction bloat with reference to programming
    //occurs when code designed to solve a problem is written in a long/convoluted way
    //normally resulting in the wasting of resources. In this example, one of the common
    //causes of bloat in software is overuse of OOP structures such as inheritance or many
    //constructors causing confusing code. This problem can normally be solved by using
    //modularity and dividing code up to make it easier to read and interpret.
