    //that behave in a similar way to a single object.
    //The intent of this pattern is to compose objects into tree structures to
    // represent part-whole hierarchies.

    //(b) Composite lets clients treat objects and compositions of objects uniformly
    //to ensure they are all treated the same way as an instance of an object.

    //(c) Component
    //Leaf
    //Composite
