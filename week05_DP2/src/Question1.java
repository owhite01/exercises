    //(a)A Strategy pattern captures, a class whose functionality or algorithm can
    // be altered at run-time. The strategy design pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one,
    // and makes them interchangeable. The strategy object changes the executing algorithm of the context object.


    //(b)It would be appropriate to use a strategy pattern if there are common situations
    // when classes are the same apart from the behaviour they adopt.
    // In this example, a strategy design pattern could be used to isolate the methods and algorithms
    // in separate classes so that the program can select different algorithms at runtime.
